<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Sorting is non-parametric approach. Using sorting we can analyze the relationship between x and y. The advantage of sorting are 1) the ability to capture non-linearity, 2) easy to implement, 3) clear interpretation of the result. The disadvantage of sorting is difficulties to control for many variables.</p>
<p>The intuition behind sorting is similar with the basic in statistics (for example, nearest K neighborhood), where we can calculate <span class="math inline">\(E[y|x = X]\)</span> by using some data point near <span class="math inline">\(x = X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Sorting is widely used in finance research since it reflects the portfolio return.</p>

<p>Conditional on high test score, what is the average of education.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(E[education | test\_score\_n = group\ 5]\)</span></p>
<p>The result of sort is as expected when we check the plot region. The group 1 (group 5) has the highest (lowest) standard deviation and lowest (highest) mean in X dimension.</p>

<div id="sorting-on-x" class="section level1">
<h1>Sorting on x</h1>
<p>Conditional on high education, what is the average of test score. The result is as expected as we see the pairs plot between education and test_score_n.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(E[test\_score\_n | education = group\ 5]\)</span></p>
<p>The result of sort is as expected when we check the plot region. The group 1 (group 5) has the lowest (highest) standard deviation and lowest (highest) mean in Y dimension.</p>
