      <description>IntroductionSorting is non-parametric approach. Using sorting we can analyze the relationship between x and y. The advantage of sorting are 1) the ability to capture non-linearity, 2) easy to implement, 3) clear interpretation of the result. The disadvantage of sorting is difficulties to control for many variables.
The intuition behind sorting is similar with the basic in statistics (for example, nearest K neighborhood), where we can calculate \(E[y|x = X]\) by using some data point near \(x = X\).</description>

      <description>InterpretationInteraction effect is important when we analyzing data. Suppose there is positive relationship between education and effort on test result. Furthermore, there is synergy effect between education and effort. Given high education, a unit increase in effort can lead to higher test result compared to those who has low education.
\(test\_score=\beta_1 ×education+ \beta_2 × effort+ \beta_3 ×education×effort + \epsilon\)
Taking derivative wrt education:
\(\partial \ test\_score / \partial \ education =\beta_1 + \beta_3 ×effort\)</description>
